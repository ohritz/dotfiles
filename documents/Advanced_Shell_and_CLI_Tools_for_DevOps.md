# Advanced Shell and CLI Tools for DevOps

# Productivity

DevOps power users often replace default shell features with faster, smarter utilities. For example, use
**zcomet** – an ultra‐lightweight Zsh plugin manager – instead of Oh My Zsh. In benchmarks zcomet “took
second place on my laptop (just behind Zim)”, far outperforming Oh My Zsh and others. It’s also backward-
compatible (Zsh 4.3.11+) and supports lazy-loading plugins via trigger commands, making startup snappier
than heavy frameworks.

**Fuzzy-search tools** dramatically speed navigation. The classic **fzf** is a “general-purpose command-line fuzzy
finder” that is “blazingly fast, portable and easy to use”. It lets you interactively search files, command
history, git branches, etc., via the keyboard. (Rust-based **skim (sk)** offers similar fuzzy search with a smaller
binary.) For example, binding fzf to <Ctrl+R> gives an interactive history search, and piping fd or
grep results into fzf narrows down files quickly. Likewise, **zoxide** replaces cd with an intelligent
jumper that remembers your most-used directories: _“a smarter cd command ... jump to [frequently visited dirs]
in only a few keystrokes”_. These tools combine to cut keystrokes and keep you in “flow”.

## Enhanced File and Diff Utilities

Traditional commands can often be improved. Instead of ls , try **eza** (a maintained fork of exa) – _“a modern
alternative for ls”_ with sensible defaults like colorized output, Git-aware icons, and human-readable sizes.
It’s a single Rust binary that adds features (hyperlinks, SELinux context, mount info, etc.) without sacrificing
speed. For paging file content, **bat** (not cited above) can be used in place of cat ; it adds syntax
highlighting and Git modification markers. To search within files, **ripgrep (rg)** is a go-to (“line-oriented
search tool... similar to grep”) that recursively respects .gitignore and is extremely fast (Rust-based). For
finding files, **fd** is _“a simple, fast, and user-friendly alternative to find”_ – its intuitive defaults and parallel search
are much quicker than the venerable find. Combining these, a typical workflow might be
fd pattern | fzf or rg regex | fzf, which is far faster than using find/grep alone.

When reviewing changes, a diff tool like **git-delta** adds color and better layouts. Delta is described as “a
syntax-highlighting pager for git, diff, and grep output” , so your git diff will highlight code syntax
and changes more readably. (Delta is written in Rust, like many of these tools, so it’s very fast.) Other useful
utilities include **jq** / **jqp** for JSON processing (filtering AWS CLI JSON output, for example), **cheat.sh** (and its
cht.sh client) for on-the-fly cheat sheets, and **shellcheck** for linting your shell scripts. These aren’t cited
here, but many users find them indispensable for shell development.

## Version and Config Management

Managing multiple language versions is seamless with **asdf** – a universal version manager. It’s “a generic
version manager with a plugin system” that lets you install and switch versions of Node, Python, Ruby, etc.,
all under one tool. With a single syntax (asdf install <lang> <ver>), it creates shims and .tool-versions files so
your tools automatically match the project. This ensures consistency across WSL and
Linux, and is often preinstalled on CI stacks.

For dotfiles and multi-machine config, **chezmoi** shines. Chezmoi “helps manage your personal config
(dotfiles) across multiple machines” using a _single source of truth_. In practice, you keep one Git branch (the
single source) of dotfiles and one chezmoi apply command to provision any machine. It supports
templating for per-machine differences and can keep secrets encrypted. As the docs explain, you maintain
_“a single branch in version control for everything public and a single password manager for all your secrets”_ , and
run one command to apply your config everywhere. This makes syncing WSL2 and Debian setups effortless.

## Kubernetes & Container CLIs

Since you work with Docker and Kubernetes daily, specialized CLIs can help. **kubectx** and **kubens** (or the
similarly named kns plugin) let you switch clusters and namespaces with one command instead of
remembering long kubectl flags. As noted by power users, kubectx “switch[es] between different
Kubernetes clusters with a simple command” and kubens lets you switch namespaces on the fly. For real-
time cluster interaction, **K9s** provides a full-screen terminal UI: view pods, logs, and metrics without leaving
the shell. And **kubecolor** simply adds color to kubectl output (“makes the output easy to read”) – a small
tweak that greatly improves readability. Tools like **stern** (to tail multiple pod logs) or **helm** /OpenShift CLIs
might also fit your workflow.

For container management, Docker’s CLI can be extended by tools like **ctop** (top-like dashboard for
containers) or by using the Docker context feature. Since you use VSCode Remote, ensure your shell tools
(fzf, eza, etc.) are installed inside the remote environment so they work over SSH. Also consider the **GitHub
CLI (gh )** or **Hub** if you collaborate on GitHub projects – it lets you open PRs and issues from the terminal.

## Modern Prompt Frameworks

The prompt itself can display status info (git branch, K8s context, etc.) in a fast, clean way. **Powerlevel10k
(P10k)** has been the de facto Zsh theme: it “emphasizes speed, flexibility and out-of-box experience”. Its
infamous _instant prompt_ means there’s no lag – “when you hit ENTER, the next prompt appears instantly”.
P10k includes many segments (git status, time, battery, kube context via custom scripts, etc.) and a built-in
configuration wizard for fine-tuning. However, Romkatv (the author) recently announced it’s “life support”
maintenance-only.

**Starship** is a popular modern alternative. It’s a cross-shell prompt written in Rust – described as “minimal,
blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable”. Because it’s compiled, Starship has “no lag” and quickly prints
context info. It has a built-in **Kubernetes module** : by default Starship can show the current cluster and
namespace in the prompt. You configure Starship via a starship.toml file (or use community presets),
and it works the same on Zsh, Bash, Fish, etc. Many users find Starship easier to extend with custom
modules, since it’s a single binary rather than a collection of shell scripts.


For comparison:

```
Kubernetes context : Starship has this out of the box (with colors and symbols). P10k can display
kube context via a custom segment or by plugging in the kubectl-context script. The original Pure
prompt has no native K8s support, though forks or “Pure Power” (P10k’s Pure style) can add it.
Performance : Both P10k and Starship are extremely fast. P10k’s design means “no prompt lag” even
in huge Git repos. Starship claims “incredible speed” and is inherently async (prompt repaints don’t
block your typing). Benchmarks vary: Starship is usually faster on a blank shell, while P10k shines in
loaded contexts (large git repo status). In practice both feel instantaneous for normal use.
Customization : P10k has a wizard and thousands of options; it even has a Pure-style theme.
Starship uses a declarative TOML config and supports custom scripts as segments. Pure (and its
rewrite “Pure++” style) is much more minimal – easier to read and fork, but less feature-rich. If you
want extreme performance, Romkatv notes “nothing comes close to Pure Power or anything based on
Powerlevel10k” , but that’s only relevant if you add tons of segments.
Async segments : P10k can compute segments asynchronously (e.g. Git status via a background
job). Starship’s modules are pre-compiled and fast; it doesn’t need a special async framework, but it
also can’t dynamically show “pending” segments after the prompt. Pure’s author even bundled a Zsh-
async plugin to hide latencies.
```
In summary, **Powerlevel10k** (with its Pure Power style) offers maximum out-of-box speed and flexibility in
Zsh, whereas **Starship** offers cross-shell compatibility, easy config, and built-in cloud/K8s modules. Both can
display git branches, status, command time, etc. If your only goal is sheer speed on Zsh, P10k wins; if you
want a modern, maintained prompt with seamless kube-support, Starship is compelling. “Pure++” isn’t an
official project, but Powerlevel10k’s Pure theme or the original Pure (Zsh) can be used for a minimalist look.

Overall, prioritize tools that compile to native code or use async patterns for snappy performance, and that
are known to work on Linux/WSL. The ones above (zcomet, fzf, zoxide, eza, asdf, chezmoi, kubectx/kubens,
kubecolor, K9s, stern, etc.) have active communities and run cleanly on Debian and WSL2. Incorporating
these will give you a highly efficient, keyboard-driven CLI experience.
